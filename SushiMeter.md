## 1. Information We Collect

Sushi Meter does **not** directly collect or store any personal information.  
All counting and history data remain on your device and are never transmitted to any server.

However, because the app uses **AdMob (Google Mobile Ads)**, Google may automatically collect limited information such as:

- Advertising ID (for ad personalization or frequency capping)  
- Approximate location (for regional ad targeting)  
- Device type, operating system, and app activity related to ad display  

This information is handled according to **Google’s Privacy Policy**:

These are **never uploaded, transmitted, or shared**.  
If you uninstall the app or clear its data, this information will be permanently deleted.
